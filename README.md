### Getting C:
  The elevator I choose is good because the buttons match the floors with the lowest on the bottom, and the highest floor on the top. It also has good features with brail, bright lights to indicate a button is pressed, and the placement of buttons such as emergency buttons low to ensure they can be reached by everyone. The bad is that at the time one of the buttons to close the door was missing, also the V floor is confusing because it is right above the G floor which would be ground, and right above the V floor is 1 so unclear what this floor V means. Also, this elevator has doors in the front and back so there are two sets of open/close door buttons with slightly different symbols which is good but unclear which ones the control without trial and error.

### Getting B:
  The most common uses for the elevator are choosing a floor and the open/close door buttons. This elevator makes those easy by the floor buttons being in order from the lowest floor button on the bottom to the highest floor button on the top. But the open/close door buttons are slightly confusing with there being two doors and two sets of buttons, and even with the slightly different symbols is not noticeable which set controls which door initially. The rare cases are the alarm and call buttons, which are made easy by their low placement to be accessible to everyone.
The common sequence of actions for the elevator is to press the up or down buttons on the outside of the elevator, get in, select a floor, elevator doors close, ride to the floor and step out. The elevator supports the user to figure this out by having buttons in order of the floors, with clear large numbers or letters corresponding to the floor and right next to the button. The elevator provides feedback by displaying a yellow ring around the button once pressed. Some mistakes that can be made with this elevator are not knowing what the V floor is and going to the wrong floor or pressing the wrong open/close door button as there are 2 sets for the front and back doors. 

Some suggestions to improve this design are to get rid of the V floor and start V at 1. This would make it clearer as to what that floor is and less confusion about where that goes.
